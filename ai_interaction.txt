Tools used: ChatGpt


How AI Was Used:
I used ChatGPT to convert my existing Sunset theme into a Night theme.
I provided my original style.css file and asked ChatGPT to transform the colors,
gradients, and overall aesthetic to create a night-time design while preserving
the structure, semantics, and accessibility of my form.
ChatGPT assisted in selecting appropriate color palettes,contrast,
and gradient effects to achieve a visually appealing and accessible night scene.

How Assignment 02 Helped Me Understand Git and GitHub:
Before Lecture 2, I only knew the basics of Git and would always push my projects
directly to the main branch without tracking changes over time. 
This lecture helped me gain a deeper understanding of using branches and how to merge them
effectively. I learned how to add new code or features to my project using separate branches,
which allows me to manage changes safely and keep my main branch stable.
